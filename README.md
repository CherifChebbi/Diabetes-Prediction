Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning
This project is a machine learning-based application designed to predict whether a person is diabetic or not based on their health data. It uses the PIMA Indian Diabetes Dataset and applies a Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a linear kernel for classification.

The project includes the following key steps:

Data Exploration: Comprehensive analysis of the dataset, including handling missing values, detecting outliers, and exploring variable distributions.
Data Preprocessing: Standardization of feature values for optimal model performance.
Model Development: Training a Support Vector Machine classifier to predict diabetes outcomes.
Model Evaluation: Assessing the model's performance using accuracy scores on training and test data.
Predictive System: A real-time prediction system that takes input data and predicts whether the individual is diabetic.
