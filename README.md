# **Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning**

This project is a machine learning-based application designed to predict whether a person is diabetic or not based on their health data. It uses the **PIMA Indian Diabetes Dataset** and applies a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** with a linear kernel for classification.

## **Key Steps**
### **1. Data Exploration**
- Comprehensive analysis of the dataset.
- Handling missing values.
- Detecting and visualizing outliers.
- Exploring variable distributions and relationships.

### **2. Data Preprocessing**
- Standardization of feature values for optimal model performance.

### **3. Model Development**
- Training a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to predict diabetes outcomes.

### **4. Model Evaluation**
- Assessing the model's performance using accuracy scores on both training and test datasets.

### **5. Predictive System**
- A real-time prediction system that accepts input data and predicts whether the individual is diabetic.
